title: Android Development Tutorial
---

## Getting Started

Please follow these instructions before the tutorial begins to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (the integrated development environment, or IDE, for building Android Apps) and configure an Android emulator (a virtual device that will allow you to run and test your prototype application).

### Installing Android Studio

Please visit [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) in order to download the version of Android studio for the operating system that you use. All major operating systems, including macOS, Windows, and most flavors of Linux are supported.

Follow the instructions for your specific operating system to finish the installation. You can find a detailed guide for specific operating systems [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).

### Configuring Your Android Emulator

Once you have installed Android studio, either navigate to the launch screen view or the code editor view in order to launch the **AVD Manager**. See the screenshots below to see the steps involved in doing this.

The first screen of the configurator wizard allows you to pick the hardware settings of your virtual Android device. This includes attributes such as the device screen size and pixel density. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be using the Nexus 5 emulator, which you can select by scrolling to and clicking on the hardware configuration as shown in the above screenshot. After you have selected the Nexus 5 profile, you can click the "Next" button.

The wizard allows you to select from many different Android versions, some of which contain proprietary Google Play APIs. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be using Android 7.0 (also called Nougat) as it has good compatibility across a range of Android devices. To use this version, you first click on the Download button, to download the software image. After the download is complete, you can then select the software version in the configuration wizard and click the "Next" button.

![Splash screen navigating to AVD Manager](../images/android-tutorial/config.png){ align=left }6. The Final screen of the configuration wizard provides some more advanced options and provides general information about the device you configured. For the purposes of this tutorial, we do not need to worry about advanced options, so you can simply click on the "Finish" button.

![Splash screen navigating to AVD Manager](../images/android-tutorial/launch.png){ align=right }7. Now that your Android emulator has been configured, you can launch the emulator by clicking on the green "play button as indicated above. This should launch your emulator and allow you to test applications!
